# BOOK-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
Build a recommender system from scratch

* Online recommendation systems are the in thing to do for many e-commerce websites. A recommendation system broadly recommends products to customers best suited to their tastes and traits.

* Building recommender systems today requires specialized expertise in analytics, machine learning and software engineering, and learning new skills and tools is difficult and time-consuming.

## Data
Book-Crossings is a book ratings dataset compiled by Cai-Nicolas Ziegler. It contains 1.1 million ratings of 270,000 books by 90,000 users. The ratings are on a scale from 1 to 10.

The data consists of three tables: ratings, books info, and users info. 
 Data can be downloaded from [here](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/)
 
 ###  Everything was coded in Google Colab, because of its GPU. I uploaded the dataset to Google Drive, so you can download it directly. Everything you need to recreate this project is on the jupyter notebook.
